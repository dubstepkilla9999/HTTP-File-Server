# HTTP-File-Server
Hosts a simple "Hello world" page accessible from a regular web browser. Also has download file command handling and a 404 error page.
The "TestFile.txt" needs to be in the same folder as the server's executable, it is the file that gets downloaded to the client browser when they click on "Download test file". To connect to the server, type its machine's IP in any browser in your local network. Could be a global server with port forwarding.
